# make Isodist available from the command line in OSX
already done, but would simply need to be added to 
/etc/paths

# start an isodist job
on OSX the precompiled executable is named 'isodist_osx_intel' NOT 'isodist'
cd to directory with input and simply type
isodist_osx_intel bubu.in

# what isodist needs in order to run something
besides isodist_osx_intel
1_par.txt (dbl renamed it from bubu.in, and it WORKS :)
2_batch.txt
3_atom.txt
4_res.txt

Envelope 2 CamelCropper 2 Isodist 2 Envelope
1.) Generate simulated spectra:
Envelope Input:
manually enter AAseq, charge and degree of labeling into Envelope
Envelope output:
*.png
*.pdf
*.csv

2.) Generating mzML files from Envelope *.csv file 
Python:
Isodist.ipynb
removes 0 and very small floats
Output:
*_clean.txt

add header and footer for MGF-style

ProteoWizard-MSConvert:
convert mfg to mzML
manually change "ms level" from 2 to 1.

3.) Extract data with CamelCropper

4.) CamelCropper txt output 2 Isodist peaks input
Isodist.ipynb
for each AAseq and each TimePoint create a separate spectrum file, which serves as input for Isodist

5.) run Isodist
output: 
one *.csv
multiple *.fit  and *.dat

6.) use *.csv as Envelope input
Envelope output:
*.png
*.pdf
*.csv

7.) create merged DataFrame with Isodist.ipynb
--> for ggplot R input


VISUALIZATION:
1.) Envelope simulated and CamelCropper extracted 
original Envelope simulated specs
CamelCropper extracted
combined with ggplot

2.) CamelCropper extracted and Isodist processed --> Envelope viz
Envelope simulated, data from Isodist
CamelCropper extracted
combined with ggplot
